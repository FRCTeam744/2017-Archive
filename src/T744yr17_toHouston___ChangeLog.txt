	TmRoFilesAndPrefKeys		add keys for climber talons and shooter installation options
								make PrefKeys class private -- it shouldn't be used now that we have PrefKeysE enum
	TmMiscSdKeys				add keys for climber talons and shooter installation options and for amps for 2nd climber motor
	Tm17Opts					add options for climber talons installation
								switch from PrefKeys to PrefKeysE as parm for preference key
								add Cnst class
	TmCfgMotors					add constants for use when no SdKeys are provided
								change (some) unused methods from public to private
								add second climber motor, do some related refactoring
	TmHdwrRoPhys				add RoNamedModulesE.CAN_TALON_34 for use for second climber motor
	TmHdwrRoMap					add named IO for second climber motor
								add support for forcing a fakeable device to be a fake (for use with climber talons)
	TmFakeable_CANTalon			replace showMaxMinOutputCurrent() with getMaxMinOutputCurrentSummary()
	TmCANTalonFeaturesI			replace showMaxMinOutputCurrent() with getMaxMinOutputCurrentSummary()
								update the max/min output current summary string when ever a new max or min is detected.
									helps performance by not having to rebuild the string in 'periodic' routines.
	TmMotorConfigEnumI			replace showMaxMinOutputCurrent() with getMaxMinOutputCurrentSummary()
	TmSsClimber					use TmFakeable_CANTalon's current monitoring capability instead of trying to manage it
									in the climber subsystem.
								add support for a second motor. Both motors turn the same direction and at the same speed.
								add code to refreshMotorSpeed() to reduce speed if current exceeds hardcoded limit of 30A.
									track the actual motor speed in use when current limit is exceeded
								add comments explaining adjustments made to joystick readings before they're used to set
									motor speeds
									
	TmTCmdShowAllAutonAlgAndPrefs	switch from PrefKeys to PrefKeysE as parm for Tt.getPreference()

    								increased first distance to 3.667 from 3.785, second distance to 5.458 from 6.208
    								and third distance to 1.5 from 1.0
=========== as of   2017-04-06_21-04
	TmSsAutonomous   				wrote four new autonomous algs: Shoot Red, Shoot Blue,
