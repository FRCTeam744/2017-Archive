Change Log for project T744yr17_toSmokies
=========== as of   2017-04-11-10-50    		===> T744yr17_toSmokies backed up as T744yr17_toSmokies_2017-04-11_22-58_Dell-snap_tunedNewAutoAlgs.zip
    TmSsAutonomous                  altered Shoot and Place Gear Red and Shoot Red to account for
    								inaccuracy of program it was based on (Place gear and Shoot Red)
    								decreased the first turn angle to 35 from 40 and second turn angle to 20 from 18
    								increased first distance to 3.667 from 3.785, second distance to 5.458 from 6.208
    								and third distance to 1.5 from 1.0
=========== as of   2017-04-06_09-04
	TmSsAutonomous   				wrote four new autonomouses  Shoot Red, Shoot Blue,
									Shoot and Place Gear Red, Shoot and Place Gear Blue.
									They are tuned to the point where they need to be tested
									an actual field.

	----------
	[backup T744yr17_toSmokies_2017-03-24_14-30_Dell-snap_gearAndShootTweak.zip 
		TmSsShooter 	modified trigger pulse on time from .100 to .800

		(among other changes)]
	
	----------
	[tweaks to autonomous, several backups made but not logged]
	
=========== as of 	2017-03-23_12-45    		===> T744yr17_toSmokies backed up as T744yr17_toSmokies_2017-03-23_12-45_Dell_adjShooterTargRps_PMatch6.zip
	TmSsShooter				[shooter encoder enabled via preferences, low speed RPS measured to be 53.0, corresponding preference set to 53.0]
							[high-speed preference value not changed]
							low speed target RPS changed to 53.0 from 69.3333333 [not on robot]
							high speed target RPS changed to 66.25 based on calculation: ((53.0/69.33333)*86.66666667) [not on robot]

=========== as of 	2017-03-23_09-59    		===> T744yr17_toSmokies backed up as T744yr17_toSmokies_2017-03-23_09-59_Dell_addLedStripRelay.zip
	TmHdwrRoMap				add relay for LED strip
	TmSsGearFlipper			add code to change color of LED strip based on flipper position
	
=========== as of 	2017-03-22_23-50    		===> T744yr17_toSmokies backed up as T744yr17_toSmokies_2017-03-22_23-50_Dell_maybeFixGyroSpinBugAndShooterEnc.zip
    TmACmdDriveSpinGyro		change minMotorSpeed from 0.1 to 0.12 (matches TmACmdDriveStraightEndWithGyro)
							change pK from 1.8 to 0.06
							[changes were made because console log showed that entire spin was at max speed and could 
								overshoot the target angle dramatically]
	TmSsShooter				increase SHOOTER_DRUM_TO_FEEDER_TRIGGER_DELAY_SECS from 0.300 to 0.500
							ShooterTriggerSteMach DELAY_OFF state: if encoder is usable, check delay timer as previously, but
								if it hasn't reached the threshold, check the drum RPS. If the drup RPS is in range, ignore
								the delay time and return to the PULSE_ON state so we shoot faster.
							[ready to test with encoder enabled (polarity reversed after bag night--never tested)]	

=========== as of 	2017-03-22_18-05    		===> T744yr17_toSmokies backed up as T744yr17_toSmokies_2017-03-22_18-05_Dell_maybeFixEncResetBug.zip
	[updated change log for previous backup]
	TmACmdDriveStraightEndWithGyro		add more info to inputDescr string to debug initialization problems
	TmMotorConfigEnumI					add notes about need to use ConnectedEncoder methods instead of calling getEncPosition() or
											setEncPosition() directly.  ConnectedEncoder will manage the position info properly based
											on the EncoderCountsCapabilityE setting.
	TmSsDriveTrain						change DrvEncoderMgmt's update() method to use ConnectedEncoder's get() method instead of
											calling the motor object's getEncPosition method directly so that the value read can
											be updated properly based on the EncoderCountsCapabilityE setting
										doTeleopInit doesn't need to call removeAllLimits() itself since it's called from commonInit()
										remove debug code from DrvEncoderMgmt's reset() method	
	
=========== as of 	2017-03-21_01-00    		===> T744yr17_toSmokies backed up as T744yr17_toSmokies_2017-03-21_01-00_AW-snap_bugFixes_autonTweaks_needsChgLog.zip
	TmACGrpRightSideGear				decrease initial forward motion about 2 inches
										increase "to peg" motion from 0.8 to 1.2 ft.
	TmACmdDriveStraightEndWithGyro		refactor field distance to m_distance to prevent confusion with local variables named distance
										change pKxDefault from 0.325 to 0.325*5 (=1.625)
										add pKxDefaultEncoders, set to 0.325*5 (=1.625)
										use new m_fbType to decide whether to initialize pKx from pKxDefault or pKxDefaultEncoders
										move inputDescr and its print statement to the end of initialize()
										set prevLfEncoderRdg and prevRtEncoderRdg to zero when "reseting" encoders
										set yError to m_distance in initialize()
										set x, y, theta and their "previous" values to 0 in intialize()
										[experimented by initializing x and prevX to 1.0 instead of 0.0, restored prior to making backup]
	TmRobotDriveSixMotors				in DriveSpeedLimits class, add new removeAllLimits() method
	TmSsAutonomous						add import for TmACGrpTestingDriveEncodersForwardThenReverse even though code that uses it
											may be commented out
	TmSsDriveTrain						call new removeAllLimits() method from commonInit
										add a synchronization lock to the drive encoder manager methods
	TmSsShooter							m_steMach.stop() from the various do...Init() methods
										doAutonomousInit() should be calling ...Mgr.doAutonomousInit(), not ...Mgr.doLwTestInit()!!

=========== as of 	2017-03-20_16-40    		===> T744yr17_toSmokies backed up as T744yr17_toSmokies_2017-03-20_16-40_JudiA_maybeFixEncodersOnlyCode.zip
	TmACmdDriveStraightEndWithGyro		in encoders-only code, don't negate x
										in updateDrv, include L/R encoder readings among variables saved
											in "previous" variables (two places).

=========== as of 	2017-03-18_22-10    		===> T744yr17_toOrlando backed up as T744yr17_toOrlando_2017-03-18_22-10_Dell_tuneAuton.zip
	TmACGrpCenterGearAndShootBlue		increase angle to 70 degrees (was 63)
	TmACGrpLeftSideGear					add comments to aid positioning
										set distance after spin to 1.2 ft instead of relying on timeout 
	TmACGrpRightSideGear				add comments to aid positioning
										set distance after spin to 0.8 ft instead of relying on timeout 	
	TmACGrpTestingDriveEncodersForwardThenReverse	created for testing, doesn't work, goes crazy
	TmACmdDriveSpinGyro					change isFinished to print console message indicating whether timed out or reached destination
	TmACmdDriveStraightEndWithGyro		add FeedbackTypesE and FeedbackResetsE enums to use to pick options.  ENCODERS_ONLY feedback type
											does not work (see TmACGrpTestingDriveEncodersForwardThenReverse)
										use only the new theta field and remove the local theta variable from execute()
	TmSsAutonomous						tag ALG_PLACE_CENTER_GEAR_AND_SHOOT_RED/BLUE algorithms as "beta test"
										tag commented-out line using TmACGrpTestingDriveEncodersForwardThenReverse for 
											ALG_TEST_DRIVE_GYRO_FORWARD_AND_REVERSE_LOW as "bad"
	TmSsDriveTrain						change default drive tuning parm values
	
=========== as of 	2017-03-18_13-11    		===> T744yr17_toOrlando backed up as T744yr17_toOrlando_2017-03-18_13-11_JudiA_mergeAllKnownChgs.zip
	TmACmdDriveStraightEndWithGyro			add enum for options for using gyro and encoders or just encoders, include in console output
											add enum for options for reseting gyro and/or encoders, include in console output
											update constructors to use new enums
											don't reset encoders/gyro if asked not to via input parms
											calculate yError and xError differently if using gyro and encoders or just encoders
											experiment with different ways of calculating desiredTheta, just to see what happens (if/elseif block)
											add new updateNav() method for running with encoders only											
	TmACmdDriveStraightEndWithGyroRev4.java_merged	encoder-only version from Alex, merged into TmACmdDriveStraightEndWithGyro.java, kept here for reference
	TmTCmdDriveHalfSpeedFor30Sec			Josh's code for testing for problems with gyro
	TmSsAutonomous							add algorithm using TmTCmdDriveHalfSpeedFor30Sec
